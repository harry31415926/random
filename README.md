This is a small program that generates non-repeating random numbers. I don't know why, but it took me a long time to write it.

Then I added selection sorting to generate random numbers without repeating and then sorted them, the program file is called "Sort + Random(Not Repeat).cpp".

You can also use bubble sort to solve the sorting problem, the file using bubble sort is called "bubble sort + random.cpp".

Recently I have tried to write an insertion sort, the file is "insertion_sort.cpp".

這是一個會產生不重覆隨機亂數的小程式，不知道為什麼，我想了比較久才寫出來。

1. 之後我再加入選擇排序，產生不重複的隨機亂數之後再加以排序，程式檔案叫做 "排序 + 亂數(不重複).cpp"。

2. 也可使用氣泡排序法來解決排序的問題，使用氣泡排序的檔案叫做 "氣泡排序+亂數.cpp"

3. 最近我又嘗試寫出插入排序的作法，檔案在 "插入排序.cpp"
